### COVID-19 Vaccination Appointment Scheduler

This is a command-line application for scheduling COVID-19 vaccination appointments, developed in Java. It interacts with a Microsoft Azure-hosted database, using SQL to manage and query appointment data. The project was completed as part of CSE 414: Database Systems at the University of Washington in Autumn 2024.
